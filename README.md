# Transfer learning 101
This repo walks you through how to train your custom classifier using transfer learning and 
how to deploy it on github pages like I have done [here](https://bjarkehautop.github.io/Transfer-learning/) in 15 mins. 

The guide can be found [here](https://github.com/BjarkeHautop/Transfer-learning/blob/main/transfer_learning_101.ipynb).
